mapp-skeletor:notifications
============

A notification package riding on top of [Push](https://github.com/raix/push "raix:push") and [Meteoric](https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic "Meteoric:meteor-ionic")

Additional requirements right now are mapp-skeletor:gestures and mapp-skeletor:user-history

Add this package with `meteor add mapp-skeletor:notifications` to get isomorphic notifications for users.
